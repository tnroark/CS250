    How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
      User stories help by making the vision of what features are needed clearer. It helps the developer look from the consumers "shoes", and allows for a product closer to what the user desires. 
      
    How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
      I approach them by first writing down the idea of what is needed, then building the framework for my program. User Stories seem very effective in developing code, as well as utilizing product backlog.
    
   What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
      Consistent communication is necessary to be a good team member. Having a positive attitude and contributing to the team is necessary as well.
